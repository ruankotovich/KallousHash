Save the MD5 hash of the original file
Encript the file in BASE64
With the MD5 generated at first, generate a map whose key is generated that way:

Example reduced MD5 : f2fdcd66d84f

(0,2,11) # f->[2,d] # {2}
(1) # 2->[f] # {1}
(3,5,8) # d->[c,6,8] # {3}
(4) # c->[d] # {1}
(6,7) # 6->[6] # {1}
(9) # 8->[4] # {1}
(10) # 4->[f] # {1}
